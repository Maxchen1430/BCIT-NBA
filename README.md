## Project Summary - Retooling the 2019-2020 Lakers' Roster
This project revovles around retooling the 2019-2020 NBA Lakers team roster using data analytics and presenting the findings through Power BI's data visualization. Given the scope and complexities of actual sport trading/business, this analysis excludes some of the more complicated real-life player/team transaction/signing scenarios in favour of a more simplified and focused data analytical project. 

## Methodology
We first focus on the weakness of the 2019-2020 Lakers lineup by comparing them to other teams in various different metrics, such as 3P, FT, TOV, BLK, etc. We then shift our focus on examining the players within the team indivdually on the same metrics. As we wrap up our internal assessment, we look at the players available in the upcoming free agency that the Lakers management can sign given their remaining slary cap space. Assuming the newly signed players perform as well as they did historically in the past, we then re-assemble the LA Lakers and assess how much the roster has improved based on the same established metrics, comparing the new lineup with other teams as well as our performance this 2019-2020 season.
